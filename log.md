My name is Devansh Trivedi and this is the log of my progress in the 100 Days of ML code challenge

I'm following guidelines from this Siraj video: [100 Days of ML Code Challenge](https://youtu.be/cuQMBj1cWPo)

**The idea is simple:**
1. Pick an industry
2. Find a Problem
3. Locate a Dataset
4. Apply AI to Data
5. Create a Solution

## Today's Progress:
✅ Step 1: Picked Music Industry  
✅ Step 2: Found a Problem: ProActive Music Selection  
✅ Made Word-Pair Frequency Graph in Neo4j using Cypher language
Used Starboy lyrics csv
## Thoughts:
This idea comes from a movie as old as me, Flubber (1997).  
Robin Williams plays 'The Professor' with this cute flying robot 'Weebo'. It [uses memes to communicate](https://youtu.be/3iO14Rxdrwk)  
It always has the perfect cartoon/clip for the occasion. I felt such need for sound effects in my life.  
Some songs are perfect for some moods and contexts.  
Hopefully, I will be able to code an AI so everyone can train it to their taste, and experience music effortlessly.  

The idea is simple: The song should match the environment. Initially, I will try **Lyrics Text Analysis** to match the lyrics with the words spoken.  
Then **Linguistic Analysis** of song lyrics will help me detect and interpret emotions, social tendencies, and language style to analyze emotions and feelings that musical artists express in their songs.

# Day 1: September 19, 2018
[**Full Report on Medium Article**](http://sync.dvnsh.com/mlday1)
## Today's Progress:
✅ Coded together a Python script with officially supported 'idiomatic' Neo4j Python driver v1 to use GraphDatabase
## Thoughts:
NLP is possible to implement natively in Node4j using Cypher queries.  
However, the ability to access it from python will open doors to many new possibilities

## Today's Progress:
✅ Fetch word frequencies into a Python dictionary  
To achieve this, I'm using Auto-commit transactions in the driver's session.
## Thoughts:
I concluded that a dictionary would be the right data structure to store the frequencies of each word

# Day 3: September 21, 2018
[**Full Report on Medium Article**](http://sync.dvnsh.com/mlday3)
## Today's Progress:
✅ Word-Pair Frequency into Python Dictionary with tuples as keys and count as values
## Thoughts:
I made the variable name easier to read.  
Now that I have the Text Adjacency Graph, I can go ahead for the Mining Word Associations

# Day 4: September 22, 2018
[**Full Report on Medium Article**](http://sync.dvnsh.com/mlday4)
## Today's Progress:
✅ Implemented Left1, Right1, Count Left1 and Right1, Find highest Left1 and Right1  
✅ Uploaded starboy.csv  
✅ Created a list of queries on Github repository for everyone else to try the same
## Thoughts:
I was amazed by the fact that the grammar articles "the" and "a" came out to be the most frequent Adjacent nodes in the graph.
I'm not sure how implementing Left2 and Right2 will help me, and how to implement those the right way.

## Today's Progress:
✅ Mining Paradigmatic Word Associations using Jaccard Index to compute similarity
## Thoughts:
Very successful, many interesting discoveries  
Yet I'm still surprised and sad that the AI could not find similarity of the word "starboy"

# Day 7: September 25, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Working on a Jupyter notebook on Content Recommendation
## Thoughts:
I now need datasets more than ever.  
MusixMatch has  
43 million tracks  
14 million lyrics  
## Link: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/johnymontana/nlp-graph-notebooks/blob/master/Content%20Recommendation.ipynb)

# Day 8: September 26, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Designing 'The Song Attribute Graph' data model and schema for Content Based filtering and Recommendation
## Thoughts:
I'm advocating content based recommendations at this stage of the project  
Today I had to guess what parameters can be taken into account to find patterns that match the environment  
To keep my project simple, I have chosen Release Date, Featuring Actor, Genre AND Keywords

# Day 9: September 27, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Created python script to generate User Preference and Song Attributes Graph for Content-based Recommendations  
✅ Signed up for MusixMatch API, got API key and Studied its documentation
## Thoughts:
I wanted to create separate functions for queries to add user, add song, add metadata and link. But because of the limitation of query variables, their scope only exists with the query. So I had to create a common function. If I still wanted to create separate ones, I'd need to MATCH them before making associations to a new variable, which would further complicate the code. I will have a workaround in Python to remedy this by creating query templates and loops.

# Day 10: September 28, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Fetched Top Artists using chart.artists.get
## Thoughts:
Following APIs are paid:
track.search
track.subtitle.get
matcher.subtitle.get

# Day 11: September 29, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Updated Python script to Iterated over names of Top Artists in #India from JSON response
## Thoughts:
Now I will combine both python files : The one that fetches data and the one that fires queries to generate nodes in the graph database to associate data.

# Day 12: September 30, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Another API call to get songs of Top Artists in India  
✅ Show these associations in the neo4j Graph Database
## Thoughts:
I need more metadata, as I couldn't get some info about tracks from MusixMatch API
## Link to work: [That new python file I thought about making yesterday](https://github.com/D3V4N5H/StarBoy/blob/master/userArtistSongMap.py)

# Day 13: October 1, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Fixed Top Artists for India (country parameter was for US) API call  
✅ Added Top Tracks in India list
## Thoughts:
track.snippet.get didn't work for starboy track_id 144134659, not even in the playground

I'm planning to use the following to compute relevance:  
chart.tracks.get  
chart.artists.get  
matcher.track.get  
track.get  
artist.albums.get  
matcher.lyrics.get  
track.lyrics.get

# Day 14: October 2, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Made a function to handle APIs better  
✅ Combined approach: Finding Best songs OF Best artists
## Thoughts:
I tested lyrics by watching the Starboy video on Youtube with MusixMatch Chrome Extension and it worked fine.  
This proves that they DO have the lyrics with them.  
But I'm not able to find the lyrics programmatically.  
Now I will try to get metadata, eventually reflecting those in the Graph.

# Day 15: October 3, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Convert listOfTracks to a dictionary with track_name, track_id as values  
✅ Fetch and Parse the Release Date
## Thoughts:
Now I have the Release Date Metadata, but that's not it. A Date Object is convenient in Python. I'm not sure it's a good move to store that information as Node in Graph. I might have to come up with a Hybrid approach if I can't sort it out tomorrow.

# Day 16: October 4, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Dropped the getReleaseDateFromTrackId function in favour of iterating from data in Top Tracks which already had the dates
## Thoughts:
The function I defined was taking too long to execute, as it was fetching track details for every top artist's every single top track. That's too many API calls (about 100, depending on number of items).  
After inspecting data from previous API calls, I noticed that if I could iterate into the nested dictionary inside tuple inside list inside the callback (phew)!

# Day 17: October 5, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Take Top Tracks in the geographical place as Training Data for AI
## Thoughts:
At this point my project seems to be leaning towards Collaborative filtering based on other users' activity

# Day 18: October 6, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Finally managed to fetch lyrics of Top Songs in #India songs to train the AI  
✅ Made API method much better
## Thoughts:
I'm not able to fetch the whole lyrics. I'll work with what I have now.  
I'm planning to take Top Tracks of India as Training Data and use Top Artists' Songs to find recommendations.

# Day 19: October 7, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ Cleared other parts in the lyrics, so it's much more readable now (Compared to yesterday)  
✅ Refactored the code
## Thoughts:
This is where my previous work about generating weighted keywords can pitch in to UNDERSTAND the lyrics.

# Day 20: October 8, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ New Python file to parse the #StarBoy lyrics  
✅ Removed background vocals in brackets
## Thoughts:
Genius.com [resources](https://genius.com/3317959) helped understand parts of the lyrics  
The data in my file is analogous to the csv file that I manually generated at the beginning of the project. Getting lyrics is now officially automated !!

# Day 21: October 9, 2018
## Today's Progress:
😭 Failed to import line by line lyrics into @neo4j (without using CSV)
## Thoughts:
Tried doing this for 4 Hours. It's too complicated.

# Day 22: October 10, 2018
## Today's Progress:
✅ [Michael Hunger](https://twitter.com/@mesirii) helps me import the data to the graph  
✅ Mining Paradigmatic Word Associations in lyrics from API calls
## Thoughts:
Today's date is 10 on 10 (10/10), and so was my progress.  
As I was wondering why the word frequency from the API fetched lyrics didn't match that of the CSV lyrics, it was comforting to recollect that I don't get FULL lyrics from the free account. Hence the difference.  
Despite that, my mining was very accurate.

I was tempted to use an iterator for the word-by-word query but when it didn't work, so I sticked with coding that part from the scratch.
