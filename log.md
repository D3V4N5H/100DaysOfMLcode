My name is Devansh Trivedi and this is the log of my progress in the 100 Days of ML code challenge

I'm following guidelines from this Siraj video: [100 Days of ML Code Challenge](https://youtu.be/cuQMBj1cWPo)

**The idea is simple:**
1. Pick an industry
2. Find a Problem
3. Locate a Dataset
4. Apply AI to Data
5. Create a Solution

# Day 0: September 18, 2018

## Today's Progress:
✅ Step 1: Picked Music Industry  
✅ Step 2: Found a Problem: ProActive Music Selection
Made Word-Pair Frequency Graph in Neo4j using Cypher language
Used Starboy lyrics csv

## Thoughts:
This idea comes from a movie as old as me, Flubber (1997).  
Robin Williams plays 'The Professor' with this cute flying robot 'Weebo'. It [uses memes to communicate](https://youtu.be/3iO14Rxdrwk)  
It always has the perfect cartoon/clip for the occasion. I felt such need for sound effects in my life.  
Some songs are perfect for some moods and contexts.  
Hopefully, I will be able to code an AI so everyone can train it to their taste, and experience music effortlessly.  

The idea is simple: The song should match the environment. Initially, I will try **Lyrics Text Analysis** to match the lyrics with the words spoken.  
Then **Linguistic Analysis** of song lyrics will help me detect and interpret emotions, social tendencies, and language style to analyze emotions and feelings that musical artists express in their songs.

# Day 1: September 19, 2018

## Today's Progress:
✅ Coded together a Python script with officially supported 'idiomatic' Neo4j Python driver v1 to use GraphDatabase

## Thoughts:
NLP is possible to implement natively in Node4j using Cypher queries.  
However, the ability to access it from python will open doors to many new possibilities
